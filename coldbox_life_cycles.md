# ColdBox Life Cycles

##Introduction

ColdBox has two modes of operation: MVC and Remote. MVC lifecycle is a normal HTTP request to the application. The Remote requests take place through our [ColdBoxProxy](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/ColdBoxProxy.cfm) objects to enable remote interfaces like: webservices, flex/AIR integration, Ajax CFC data binding. We have created some awesome looking diagrams so you can follow the lifecycles which are extremely important to a developer in order to understand where they can intercept user requests, inject security, morph requests, etc.

# Requirements

By default all [ColdBox](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/ConfigurationCFC.cfm) application templates and generated applications have SES support built in via our SES interceptor. This is declared in your configuration file ColdBox.cfc. This will allow you to build URI's by fowarding them through the index.cfm.

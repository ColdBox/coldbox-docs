# Layouts & Views

ColdBox provides you with a very simple but flexible and powerful layout manager and content renderer. You no longer need to create module tags or convoluted broken up HTML anymore. You can concentrate on the big picture and create as many layouts as your application needs. Then you can programmatically change rendering schemas (or skinning) and also create composite views. 

In this section we will explore the different rendering mechanisms that ColdBox offers and also how to utilize them. As you know, [event handlers](../event_handlers/index.md) are our controller layer in ColdBox and we will explore how these objects can interact with the user in order to render content, whether HTML, JSON, XML or any type of rendering data.

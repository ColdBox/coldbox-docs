It is believed that the earlier a bug is found the cheaper it is to fix it. This is something to remember as when things affect our income is when we become babies and really want to fix things then. So always take into consideration that bugs do cost money and we can be proactive about it. So what are some things apart from unit testing that we can do to improve the quality of our software? Well, apart from applying our functional and non-functional testing approaches we can also do some static and dynamic testing of our software.

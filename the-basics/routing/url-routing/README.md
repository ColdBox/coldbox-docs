# URL Routing

There are several routing methods you will use to create routes for your application:

* `addRoute()` - Add URL routing to controllers and actions with RESTful capabilities
* `addNamespace()` - Ability to group routes on a specific URL pattern entry point
* `addModuleRoutes()` - Ability to regsiter a specific URL pattern entry point for a module
* `with(), endWith()` - Context methods that will allow you to prefix or default repetitive patterns in the arguments of `addRoute()`

Please note that order of declaration is important as you are building a routing table with order preference.

> **Info** Please remember to check out the latest [API Docs](http://apidocs.ortussolutions.com/coldbox/current) for the latest methods and argument signatures.

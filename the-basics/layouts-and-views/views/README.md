# Views

Views are HTML/XML content that can be rendered inside of a layout or by themselves. They can be either rendered on demand or by being set by an event handler. Views can also produce any type of content apart from HTML like JSON/XML/WDDX via our view renderer that we will discover also. So get ready for some rendering goodness!

# Non-Functional Testing

[Non Functional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_testing) Testing are testing aspects that are not related to our specific requirements but more of the quality of our software. 

* Can our software scale? 
* Is our software performant?
* Can it sustain load? What is the maximum load it can sustain? 
* What do we do to extend our security? Are our servers secure?

# ColdBox
The ColdBox directive is where you configure the framework for operation.  

## Application Setup

```js
coldbox = {
    // The name of the application
	appName   = "My App",
	// The name of the incoming URL/FORM/REMOTE variable that tells the framework what event to execute. Ex: index.cfm?event=users.list
	eventName = "event"
};
```

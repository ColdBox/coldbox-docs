# Settings

These are custom application settings that you can leverage in your application.

```js
// Custom Settings
settings = {
	useSkins = true,
	myCoolArray = [1,2,3,4],
	skinsPath = "views/skins",
	myUtil = createObject("component","#appmapping#.model.util.MyUtility")
};
```

You can read our [Using Settings](../../using_settings.md) section to discover how to use all the settings in your application.

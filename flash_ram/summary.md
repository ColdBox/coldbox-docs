# Summary

The ColdBox Flash RAM is an excellent utility to help you create basic or even complex conversations between events and be able to persist data across requests. I really encourage you to start using the Flash RAM capabilities and go funky with them. Expect great things to come as we develop our webflow and conversation DSL language in versions to come.

# My First ColdBox Application

CommandBox comes with a `coldbox create app` command that can enable you to create application skeletons using one of our official skeletons:

* *AdvancedScript (default)*
* Advanced (Tags)
* Rest
* Elixir
* Elixir-Bower
* Elixir-Vuejs
* Simple
* SuperSimple

> You can find all our templates here: [github.com/coldbox-templates](https://github.com/coldbox-templates)

So let's create our first app: `coldbox create app MyApp`. This will scaffold the application and install ColdBox for you. Just start a server so we can see our application: ` server start --rewritesEnable`.  This command will open a web browser and give you a welcome to ColdBox page. That's it, you have just created your first application.

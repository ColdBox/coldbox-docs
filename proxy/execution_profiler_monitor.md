# Execution Profiler Monitor

![](ProfileMonitor.png)

This monitor will keep a stack of the latest X requests and their execution profiles that is all configurable via the ConfigurationCFC. This monitor can be kept side by side with your remote application or any front-end and give you execution profiles about your event model and show you event tracers. By default the request profiler is turned off, so you will have to turn it on via the new Debugger Settings in your configuration file. You can also choose the max number of requests to persist execution profiles for, so you can keep track of any amount of requests.

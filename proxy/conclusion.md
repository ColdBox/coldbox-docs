# Conclusion

As you can see, calling the ColdBox proxy from flex or any remote interface is very easy, but extremely powerful. Some applications for the proxy are :

* Remote Event driven Model Framework
* One configuration file for all application GUI's
* One common application language for all backend operations
* Multiple GUI's running on one single ColdBox application
* Enhanced service layers (caching, logging, AOP, interceptions, etc)
* Create beautiful RIA applications with a solid backend
* Create widgets and application monitors.
* What your imagination dictates.

Indeed, the ColdBox proxy is a great feature to complement your already great ColdBox applications. You can now use a standardized language for application development in all your front-ends.

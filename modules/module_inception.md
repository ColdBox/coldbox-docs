# Module Inception

![](../images/Modules.png)

ColdBox 4 allows you to nest modules within modules up to the Nth degree. Our final move to hiearchical MVC is complete. Now you can package a module with other modules that can even contain other modules within. It really opens a great opportunity for better packaging, delivery and a further break from monolithic applications. To use, just create a modules folder in your module and drop the modules there as well.

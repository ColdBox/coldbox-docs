# Overriding Views

This tells the framework to render the simple/index.cfm view in the module simpleModule. However, let's override the view first. Go to the host application's views folder and create a folder called modules and then a folder according to the module name, in our case simpleModule:

```js
/MyApp
  + views 
    + modules 
       + simpleModule
```

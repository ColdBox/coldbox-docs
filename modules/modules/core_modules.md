# Core Modules

There are several core modules that are maintained by Ortus Solutions that will bring several enhancements to a core ColdBox MVC installation.  

> **Info**: They used to be part of the core ColdBox Framework before 4.0.0 modularization.

## `cborm` - ORM Extensions
* Source: https://github.com/ColdBox/cbox-cborm
* ForgeBox: http://forgebox.io/view/cborm

This module provides you with several enhancements when interacting with the ColdFusion ORM via Hibernate. It provides you with virtual service layers, active record patterns, criteria and detached criteria queries, entity compositions, populations and so much more to make your ORM life easier!

```
install cborm
```

## `cbvalidation` - ORM Extensions
* Source: https://github.com/ColdBox/cbox-validation
* ForgeBox: http://forgebox.io/view/cbvalidation

ColdBox sports its own server side validation engine so it can provide you with a unified approach to object and form validation.

```
install cbvalidation
```

# ColdBox Debugger

As you know, ColdBox provides you (The Developer) with many great tools and visual representations of your application. The ones that are invaluable for AJAX/Remote development are the cache panel monitor and the execution profiler monitor. You can read more about these panels by [Clicking Here](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/URLActions.cfm#Debugpanel).

Here is a screenshot of the Cache Monitor:

Here is screenshot of the execution profiler:

What you will find in the execution profiler that is invaluable, is that if you are doing ajax calls via the coldbox proxy, then you can actually see that data that comes in a request, then see the execution of the request, and then finally see the outcome of the request. No need to figure out what in the world happened during that call. The monitor is an essential tool in today's web application development.

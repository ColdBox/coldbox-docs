# HTTP Method Security

More than often you will find that certain web operations needs to be restricted in terms of what HTTP verb is used to access a resource. For example, you do not want form submissions to be done via GET but via POST or PUT operations. HTTP Verb recognition is also essential when building strong RESTFul APIs and security is needed as well.

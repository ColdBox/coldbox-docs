# Rendering Data
Every event handler controller can render data back to its caller in several formats: views/layouts, return data and <code>event.renderdata()</code>.  Out of the box ColdBox can marshall data (structs,queries,arrays,complex or even ORM entities) into the following output formats:

* XML
* JSON
* JSONP
* HTML
* TEXT
* WDDX
* PDF
* Custom

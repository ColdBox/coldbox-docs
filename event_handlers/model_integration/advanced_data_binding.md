# Advanced Data Binding

[WireBox](http://wirebox.ortusbooks.com/content/wirebox_object_populator/index.html) also sports several advanced data binding techniques:

* `populateFromJSON()`
* `populateFromQuery()`
* `populateFromQueryWithPrefix()`
* `populateFromStruct()`
* `populateFromXML()`


We suggest you look at the latest [API Docs ](http://apidocs.ortussolutions.com/coldbox/current) for the correct arguments.

```js
wirebox.getObjectPopulator().populateFromXXXX()

getPlugin("BeanFactory").populateFromXXXX()
```

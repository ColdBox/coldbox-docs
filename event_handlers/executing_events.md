# Executing Events

Apart from executing events from the URL/FORM or Remote interfaces, you can also execute events internally, either **public** or **private** from within your event handlers or from interceptors, other handlers, layouts or views. You do this by using the <code>runEvent()</code> method which is inherited from our <code>FrameworkSuperType</code> class.

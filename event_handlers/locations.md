# Locations

All your handlers will go in the **handlers** folder of your application template. Also notice that you can create packages or sub-folders inside of the handlers directory. This is encouraged on large applications so you can section off or package handlers logically and get better maintenance and URL experience. If you get to the point where your application needs even more decoupling and separation, please consider building [ColdBox Modules](../modules/index.md) instead.

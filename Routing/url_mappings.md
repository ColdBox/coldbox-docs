# URL Mappings

URL mapping or routing is done via our routing methods:

* addRoute() - Add URL routing to controllers and actions with RESTful capabilities
* addNamespace() - Ability to group routes on a specific URL pattern entry point
* addModuleRoutes() - Ability to regsiter a specific URL pattern entry point for a [ColdBox Module](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/Modules.cfm)
* with(), endWith() - Context methods that will allow you to prefix or default repetitive patterns in the arguments of addRoute()

# IDE Integration

We have created some extensions for popular IDE's, but you can ultimately use any CFML enabled editor.

## Adobe ColdFusion Builder
We have a native extension for ColdFusion Builder which will allow you to extend the editor for ColdBox/TestBox capabilities: [ColdBox Platform Utilities](http://forgebox.io/view/ColdBox-Platform-Utilities).

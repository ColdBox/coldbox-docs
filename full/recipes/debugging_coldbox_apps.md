# Debugging ColdBox Apps

We have a special module just for helping you monitor and debug ColdBox applications.  To install, fire up CommandBox and install it as a dependency in your application:

```bash
install cbdebugger --saveDev
```

Remember that this module is for development so use the `--saveDev` flag.  This will install the ColdBox Debugger module for you, which will attach a debugger to the end of the request and give you lots of flexibility.  Please read the instructions here in order to spice it up as you see fit: https://github.com/ColdBox/cbox-debugger

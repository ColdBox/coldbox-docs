# Core Interception Points

There are many interception points that occur during an MVC and Remote life cycle in a ColdBox application. We highly encourage you to follow our flow diagrams in our RequestLifecycles guide so you can see where in the life cycle these events fire. Also remember that each event can pass a data structure that can be used in your application. So always look at the interceptData structure for elements you can use.
